# Hi, I'm Bailey ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**baileylamm/baileylamm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a senior at the University of Iowa, and my GitHub page features some of my work. I am studying business analytics, finance, and risk management and insurance.
